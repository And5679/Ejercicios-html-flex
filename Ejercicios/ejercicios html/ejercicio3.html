        <p>Mi dog sasha is my best friend.She likes to chose<br> the soccer ball when I
            practice .It is so funny to<br> see her running down the field trying to catch
           the <br>ball with her mouth.It just won't fitl

    <p >Once sasha saved my life.When I was only 4 years old,I started to go into the street to get a ball  that<br>
         had rolled across the street.Of course I did not think to look for carsl sasha got in front of me and<br>
         knocked me backwardd onto the sidewalk.I was mod until I sow the car go by where I would have been.<br>
        Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!
